To use the website. First simply use the first input file on the left. It will start to auto play after loading the file, then if you press the 'Reverb' button twice, the reverb will start to play. You can make it more apparent with the 'Reverb Vol' slider. If you've hit the reverb button, you can use the 'Toggle' button to toggle between the reverb only or the reverb and original. Play and pause do what they say. The second 'Choose file' is if you want to use your own "Impulse Response" file for the reverb effect. The radio inputs change the amount of channels for the reverb (only works with the Reverb button, not the impulse response files).
